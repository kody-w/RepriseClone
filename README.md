## Getting Started

### Option 1: Bookmarklet (Recommended - Works on ANY Site!)

The easiest way to record any webpage:

1. Start a local server:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

2. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
3. Click "Get Bookmarklet"
4. Drag the "üìπ Record Page" button to your bookmarks bar
5. Navigate to ANY webpage you want to record (Google, Microsoft 365, your own sites, etc.)
6. Click the bookmarklet in your bookmarks bar
7. A floating control panel appears - click "Start Recording"
8. Interact with the page normally
9. Click "Stop Recording" then "Export Recording"
10. Load the JSON file in the Player to watch the replay!

**Benefits:**
- Works on external sites (no iframe limitations)
- No CORS issues
- Draggable control panel
- Real-time event counter
- Works on any modern browser

### Option 2: Iframe Recorder (Local Pages Only)

For recording local pages in an embedded iframe:

1. Open `recorder.html`
2. Enter a local URL (like `demo.html`)
3. Click "Load" and then "Start Recording"
4. Interact with the page
5. Click "Stop Recording" and "Export Recording"

**Note:** This method only works for same-origin pages due to browser security restrictions.

## How It Works

### Recording

The recorder uses rrweb to:
1. Take a snapshot of the initial DOM state
2. Monitor all DOM mutations using MutationObserver
3. Capture user interactions (clicks, inputs, scrolling)
4. Record all events with timestamps
5. Export as a JSON file containing the event stream

### Playback

The player uses rrweb-player to:
1. Load the JSON recording file
2. Reconstruct the initial DOM state
3. Replay all events at their original timestamps
4. Provide playback controls (play, pause, speed adjustment)

### Using Playback Flags

Flags allow you to mark important moments and navigate through your recording step-by-step:

1. **Load a recording** in the player
2. Click **"üö© Flags"** button to open the flags panel
3. **Pause or play** to the moment you want to mark
4. Click **"+ Add Flag at Current Time"**
5. Enter a label (e.g., "Introduction", "Feature Demo", "Conclusion")
6. Optionally add a description
7. Click **"Save Flag"**

**Navigation:**
- Click **"‚Üê Prev"** or **"Next ‚Üí"** to jump between flags
- Click any flag in the list to jump to that moment
- Use keyboard shortcuts: `[` or `‚Üê` for previous, `]` or `‚Üí` for next
- Click the delete (√ó) button to remove a flag

**Export:**
- Click **"Export with Flags"** to save the recording with all your flags included
- Flags will be loaded automatically when you import the recording again

**Use Cases:**
- Create step-by-step product demos
- Mark key moments for presentation
- Build interactive tutorials
- Navigate long recordings efficiently

### Frame-Based Animation

Turn your flags into custom animations by capturing individual frames:

**Capturing Frames:**
1. Load a recording and open the **üö© Flags** panel
2. Add flags at moments you want to capture
3. Navigate to each flag (using prev/next or clicking)
4. Click **"üì∏ Capture Current Frame"** at each flag
5. The flag gets a üé¨ indicator showing a frame is captured
6. Make edits to the page (text, hide elements, etc.)
7. Capture another frame at the next flag

**Playing Animations:**
1. Once you have frames captured at multiple flags
2. Click **"‚ñ∂Ô∏è Play Animation"**
3. The player automatically cycles through your frames
4. Adjust **Animation Speed** slider (0.5s - 3s per frame)
5. Click **"‚èπ Stop Animation"** to stop

**Navigation with Frames:**
- When clicking flags with captured frames, the frame loads instead of seeking video
- Press **"‚Üê Prev"** or **"Next ‚Üí"** to step through frames manually
- Each frame shows your custom edits
- Create custom animations by editing each frame differently

**Workflow Example:**
```
1. Record a demo
2. Add flags at: "Start", "Middle", "End"
3. Go to "Start" flag ‚Üí Edit text to "Welcome!" ‚Üí Capture frame
4. Go to "Middle" flag ‚Üí Edit text to "Feature Demo" ‚Üí Capture frame
5. Go to "End" flag ‚Üí Edit text to "Thank You!" ‚Üí Capture frame
6. Click "Play Animation" ‚Üí Watch text change automatically!
```

**Export Options:**

1. **Export with Flags** - Saves full recording + flags + frames (large file)
   - Frame data includes full HTML snapshot
   - Re-import to continue editing or playing animation
   - Includes original rrweb event stream

2. **üé¨ Export Framed Animation** - Saves ONLY frames (lightweight!)
   - **No rrweb events** - just the captured frames
   - **Massive data savings** (typically 50-90% smaller)
   - Plays through frames step-by-step
   - Can be loaded in player like a normal recording
   - Perfect for sharing animated demos

**Framed Animation Format:**
```json
{
  "type": "framed-animation",
  "version": "1.0",
  "frames": [
    { "id": 123, "label": "Intro", "html": "..." },
    { "id": 456, "label": "Demo", "html": "..." }
  ]
}
```

**Loading Framed Animations:**
- Load like any recording - player auto-detects the format
- Shows **"üé¨ FRAMED ANIMATION"** badge
- Custom playback controls (Play, Prev, Next, Speed)
- No timeline scrubbing - just frame-by-frame navigation
- All editing tools still work (text editor, hide/show, etc.)

**Use Cases:**
- Custom product demos with changing content
- Animated tutorials with step-by-step changes
- Before/after comparisons
- Multi-state UI demonstrations
- Interactive presentations
- **Sharing lightweight animated demos** (small file size!)
